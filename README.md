# Miscellaneous Blocks for Minecraft 1.12

This mod introduces various blocks to the Vanilla game.  The new blocks are ones that I feel are 'missing' from the game, such as more variants for walls.

## Current Blocks
* Walls for all vanilla wood variants


## Current Items


## Planned
* Walls, stairs, and slabs for various blocks
